# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio repository! This collection showcases a variety of data science projects I've completed, demonstrating my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and problem-solving across different domains.
Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of data science projects that I've worked on. Each project demonstrates different aspects of the data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model development and evaluation. These projects reflect my journey in applying data science techniques to real-world problems and datasets.

# Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

Each project has its own directory
Within each project directory, you'll find:

A detailed README explaining the project
Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the analysis
Any necessary data files or links to data sources
Additional resources or documentation specific to the project



# Technologies Used
The projects in this portfolio primarily use the following technologies:

Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Data analysis libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Big data tools: Apache Spark, Google BigQuery

# Projects
(This section will be updated with brief descriptions of each project as they are added to the repository.)

## Google Store Customer Return Prediction

  The primary goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting user retention for Google's online merchandise store. By accurately identifying potential returning customers, the model aims to   enhance the conversion rate of ad spend and optimize marketing efforts.
