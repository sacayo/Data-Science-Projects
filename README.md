## Projects
(This section will be updated with brief descriptions of each project as they are added to the repository.)

##### [Final Wriiten Reports](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Final-Written-Reports)
In this directory, you will find all the written reports for some of the projects.

##### [Full-Stack Generative AI Application Deployed on AWS](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/rag-pipeline)
Built a production-ready, end-to-end RAG system over 7.6GB of web-scraped legal ordinances from 421 counties across four states, enabling centralized, cross-jurisdictional research with hybrid semantic and keyword search. The full-stack GenAI application was deployed using AWS services with a Flask backend, Llama 3.1 inference, and scalable ingestion pipelines, and was developed in close collaboration with UC Berkeley’s Responsibility Lab as the primary stakeholder.

##### [Southwest Airlines Flight Delay Prediction with Databrick's PySpark](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Flight-Delay-Prediction)
Using data from Bureau of Transportation Statistics, we experimented with classification models(Logistic Regression, XGBoost, NN) to predict flight delays with a estimated bussiness outcome of $20 million in cost savings for Southwest Airlines. We leveraged Databricks to engineer an streaming ML pipeline for a dataset of 90+ million rows. Using carefully defined features, we were able to predict delays with a 75% F2-score.

##### [RAG QA System Evlaution with RAGAS](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/RAG-System-Evaluation)
Designed a LLM system evalution for Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines using the RAGAS framework. Tuned various hyperparameters(chunking strategies, embedding models, LLM models) to increase quality of response outputs against a set of 100 groundtruth question-answer pairs.

##### [Google Store Customer Return Prediction](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Google-Customer-Return-Prediction)
The primary goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting user retention for Google's online merchandise store. The final LSTM model achieved an 93.72% recall rate on the test set, significantly outperforming the baseline Logistic Regression model. 

##### [YouTube Engagement A/B-Test](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/YouTube-AB-Test)
This project investigates the causal impact of injecting Bitcoin-related comments on YouTube video engagement through a randomized controlled trial experiment. Utilizing YouTube's Data API for data collection and R for statistical analysis, we implemented a multi-level, between-subject experiment. Despite roadblock, we concluded there was no casual effects from this experiments.

##### [Refugee Network Analysis with NoSQL](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Refugee-Network-Analysis-with-NoSQL)
This project analyzes global refugee movements from 2020-2022 using data from UNHCR, UNRWA, and IDMC, leveraging Neo4j for network analysis. We created graph representations of refugee flows between countries, applied PageRank and community detection algorithms, and visualized results in Neo4j.

##### [Generational Income Trend Analysis](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Generational-Income-Trend-Analysis)
This project examines the interrelation of age and income among different generations using data from the General Social Survey. Employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors, we analyzed how age, education, and work hours influence income. For a more detail overview, click the link to the GitHub directory above. 

##### [Spotify Hit Song Predictor](https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Spotify-Hit-Song-Predictor)
This project analyzes over 32,000 Spotify tracks to uncover the factors influencing song popularity across different genres and time periods. Using various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest Regression, we explored musical attributes, genre trends, and their impact on track popularity.
