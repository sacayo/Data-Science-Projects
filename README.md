# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio repository! This collection showcases a variety of data science projects I've completed, demonstrating my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and problem-solving across different domains.
Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of data science projects that I've worked on. Each project demonstrates different aspects of the data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model development and evaluation. These projects reflect my journey in applying data science techniques to real-world problems and datasets.

# Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

Each project has its own directory
Within each project directory, you'll find:

A detailed README explaining the project
Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the analysis
Any necessary data files or links to data sources
Additional resources or documentation specific to the project



# Technologies Used
The projects in this portfolio primarily use the following technologies:

#### Python
#### Jupyter Notebooks Data analysis libraries: Pandas, NumPy
#### Database: SQL, NoSQL, Neo4j
#### Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
#### Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
#### Big data tools: AWS, Docker

# Projects
(This section will be updated with brief descriptions of each project as they are added to the repository.)

##### Google Store Customer Return Prediction https://github.com/sacayo/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Google%20Customer%20Return%20Prediction

The primary goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting user retention for Google's online merchandise store. The final LSTM model achieved an impressive 93.72% recall rate on the test set, significantly outperforming the baseline Logistic Regression model. 

##### YouTube Engagement A/B-test
This project investigates the causal impact of Bitcoin-related comments on YouTube video engagement through a randomized controlled trial. Utilizing YouTube's Data API for data collection and R for statistical analysis, we implemented a multi-level, between-subject experiment. Link to GitHub above.

##### Refugee Network Analysis with NoSQL
This project analyzes global refugee movements from 2020-2022 using data from UNHCR, UNRWA, and IDMC, leveraging Neo4j for network analysis. We created graph representations of refugee flows between countries, applied PageRank and community detection algorithms, and visualized results in Neo4j.



##### Generational Income Trend Analysis
This project examines the interrelation of age and income among different generations using data from the General Social Survey. Employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with robust standard errors, we analyzed how age, education, and work hours influence income. Link to the GitHub above. 

##### Spotify Hit Song Predictor
This project analyzes over 32,000 Spotify tracks to uncover the factors influencing song popularity across different genres and time periods. Using various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest Regression, we explored musical attributes, genre trends, and their impact on popularity.
