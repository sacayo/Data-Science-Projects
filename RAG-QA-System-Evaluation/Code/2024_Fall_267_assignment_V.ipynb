        "You work at a tech company that is looking for new ways to organize their question answering and search capabilities to accelerate both engineering activity and the marketing team's production. The company also wants to roll out new GenAI-based products, so a lot of the questions will center around Generative AI concepts. The company has about 300 engineers and a marketing staff of 40. Product releases are done quarterly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your role is to implement and conduct a (mini-)POC helping the company to evaluate RAG capabilities for the improvement of their document search (and corresponding question answering), supporting particularly the engineering and marketing organizations. You will have a gold dataset with 'good' responses to questions from marketing and engineering teams. You need to develop metric(s) that help you to evaluate how well your RAG system performs relative to the gold data. You should work with the tunables of the setup (LLM, chunking, embeddings, ...) for your iterations.\n",

The research findings suggest that increasing the number of retrieved documents can lead to better performance for some models, such as RAG-Sequence, where more documents result in improved QA results. However, for RAG-Token, the performance peaks at 10 retrieved documents, indicating that more documents do not necessarily lead to better performance.\\n\\nThe choice of the number of retrieved documents is a trade-off between performance and computational overhead. While more documents can enhance performance, it also increases the computational resources required. In the case of RAG-Token, the optimal number of documents is 10, as it balances performance and efficiency.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that the number of re-ranked documents does not significantly affect performance, and they settled on 25 re-ranked documents to minimize computational overhead.

This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology,[11] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[12] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\".[13] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model.\n",

            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "reference: The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections.\n",
            "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "response: The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion can be significant, as it sets a precedent for other countries and influences the global discourse on reproductive rights. Here are some potential implications:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Influence on other countries: The Supreme Court's ruling can serve as a reference point for other countries grappling with their own abortion laws. It can provide legal arguments and reasoning that advocates for reproductive rights can use to challenge restrictive abortion laws in their respective jurisdictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Strengthening of global reproductive rights movements: A favorable ruling by the Supreme Court can energize and empower reproductive rights movements worldwide. It can serve as a rallying point for activists and organizations advocating for women's rights, leading to increased mobilization and advocacy efforts globally.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Counteracting anti-abortion movements: Conversely, a ruling that restricts abortion rights can embolden anti-abortion movements globally. It can provide legitimacy to their arguments and encourage similar restrictive measures in other countries, potentially leading to a rollback of existing reproductive rights.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Impact on international aid and policies: The Supreme Court's ruling can influence international aid and policies related to reproductive health. It can shape the priorities and funding decisions of donor countries and organizations, potentially leading to increased support for reproductive rights initiatives or conversely, restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Shaping international human rights standards: The ruling can contribute to the development of international human rights standards regarding reproductive rights. It can influence the interpretation and application of existing human rights treaties and conventions, potentially strengthening the recognition of reproductive rights as fundamental human rights globally.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Global health implications: The Supreme Court's ruling can have implications for global health outcomes, particularly in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It can impact the availability and accessibility of safe and legal abortion services, potentially leading to an increase in unsafe abortions and related health complications.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is important to note that the specific implications will depend on the nature of the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent actions taken by governments, activists, and organizations both within and outside the United States.\n",

Companies should disclose how algorithms work and take steps to address any unintended consequences.\\n\\n4. Accessibility and inclusivity: Social media companies should strive to make their platforms accessible to users of all languages and abilities. This includes providing language options, captioning for videos, and features that accommodate users with disabilities, ensuring equal access to information and participation.\\n\\n5. Fighting disinformation: Companies should actively combat the spread of disinformation and fake news on their platforms. This involves implementing fact-checking mechanisms, partnering with credible sources, and promoting media literacy to help users distinguish between reliable and misleading information.\\n\\n6. Transparency and accountability: Social media companies should be transparent about their policies, practices, and decision-making processes. They should provide clear avenues for users to report issues, appeal content removals, and seek redress. Regular transparency reports can help build trust and hold companies accountable.\\n\\n7. Collaboration with external stakeholders: Companies should collaborate with governments, civil society organizations, and experts to develop policies and practices that protect users' rights. Engaging in multi-stakeholder dialogues helps ensure diverse perspectives are considered and fosters a collective effort to address online challenges.\\n\\nOverall, social media companies have a responsibility to create a safe, inclusive, and rights-respecting online environment for all users, regardless of their language and political views.\",\n          \"Criminalizing abortion can have severe consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who are already facing various forms of discrimination and inequality. Some of the consequences include:\\n\\n1. Health risks: When abortion is criminalized, individuals may resort to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancies, leading to serious health complications and even death. Marginalized individuals, who often have limited access to healthcare and resources, are more likely to be affected by these risks.\\n\\n2. Economic burden: Marginalized individuals, who are more likely to face financial constraints, may struggle to afford safe and legal abortions in countries where it is criminalized. This can lead to increased financial burdens, as they may have to travel long distances or seek expensive underground services.\\n\\n3. Limited reproductive choices: Criminalizing abortion restricts individuals' reproductive choices and autonomy. Marginalized individuals, who already face various barriers to accessing healthcare and education, may be further limited in their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\\n\\n4. Increased inequality: Criminalizing abortion disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities. Women from low-income backgrounds, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas often face additional barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, further widening the gap between privileged and marginalized groups.\\n\\n5. Criminalization of pregnancy: In some cases, criminalizing abortion can lead to the criminalization of pregnancy itself. This can result in the surveillance and punishment of pregnant individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be subjected to invasive monitoring, discrimination, and even imprisonment for actions perceived as harmful to the fetus.\\n\\n6. Mental health impact: The criminalization of abortion can have significant psychological consequences for marginalized individuals. The stigma and shame associated with seeking illegal abortions or being unable to access safe services can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\\n\\n7. Reproductive injustice: Criminalizing abortion perpetuates reproductive injustice by denying marginalized individuals the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health. It reinforces systemic inequalities and denies them the same reproductive rights and freedoms enjoyed by more privileged individuals.\\n\\nIt is important to note that these consequences are not limited to criminalizing abortion alone but are often intertwined with broader social, economic, and healthcare disparities faced by marginalized communities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections.\",\n          \"Social media companies play a role in protecting users' rights online, regardless of their language and political views, by investing in human oversight of content moderation systems, engaging in human rights due diligence, and educating users about security and privacy features.\",\n          \"The consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals include increased stigma, lack of information, and disinformation. This can have severe and irreversible effects on these individuals. Girls and young women may be forced to carry pregnancies resulting from sexual violence due to a lack of knowledge about their rights. Marginalized individuals, such as those living in poverty, historically discriminated against, Indigenous and Afro-descendent women, migrants, and refugees, are disproportionately affected by abortion criminalization. The criminalization of abortion is a major factor contributing to the high number of unsafe abortions, which leads to increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Access to health services is undermined, resulting in preventable maternal deaths and complications. Marginalized individuals are forced to resort to unsafe clandestine abortion methods, putting their lives and health at risk. In Nigeria, restrictive abortion laws make it difficult to access safe abortion care.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context_recall\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22360679774997902,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"factual_correctness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.24844851914766297,\n        \"min\": 0.15,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.22,\n          0.5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"faithfulness\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3134368672887568,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9047619047619048,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llm_context_precision_with_reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 0.9999999999666668,\n        \"max\": 0.9999999999666668,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9999999999666668\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In contrast to the additive method where fixed sinusoidal functions are added to the embeddings as positional encodings, RoPE utilizes a rotation operation to incorporate positional information into the input sequences. This results in more effective representation of the sequence order and better handling of long-range dependencies compared to the additive method.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning allows language models to mitigate domain shifts by adhering to specific instructions given during the training process. This approach has been demonstrated to provide several advantages over other methods. By focusing on the instructions rather than the input data itself, these models can maintain consistency across various domains and generate outputs tailored to specific tasks. Additionally, they require less labeled data compared to fine-tuning on downstream tasks, making them an efficient solution for generating human-like text without extensive data requirements.\",\n          \"The analysis suggests that models can be influenced by the clarity and specificity of instructions given to them. Instructions that are too general or open-ended may result in unreliable outputs, while those that are clear and explicit tend to yield more accurate results (as indicated in the first document). Additionally, models' performance can depend on their training to utilize facts from provided text, which affects their ability to generate factually correct responses (second document).

This method treats position as a discrete feature, which may limit the model's ability to capture complex positional relationships.\\n\\nIn contrast, RoPE employs a relative position formulation, where the positional information is encoded through a rotation matrix. This matrix is applied to the input token embeddings, allowing the model to capture relative positional relationships more effectively. By using a rotation-based mechanism, RoPE enables the model to learn and represent positional information in a continuous and dynamic manner, potentially improving its ability to understand and utilize positional context.\\n\\nThe key difference lies in the way position is represented and integrated into the model. While the additive method adds a fixed position embedding, RoPE uses a rotational approach, providing a more flexible and expressive way to encode positional information, which is crucial for tasks that heavily rely on understanding the order and structure of the input sequence.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning in language models offers several advantages. One significant benefit is its ability to mitigate domain shifts, ensuring that the model's performance remains consistent across different domains or datasets. This is particularly useful when dealing with diverse and dynamic data, as it helps to maintain the model's accuracy and adaptability.\\n\\nMoreover, instruction-based finetuning has been shown to enhance the overall performance of language models, making them more effective and reliable for various tasks. This technique allows for better customization and optimization of the model's capabilities, leading to improved outcomes in specific applications.\\n\\nRecent research in this area has demonstrated the potential of instruction-finetuned language models, opening up new possibilities for more advanced and tailored AI solutions in the marketing and branding realm.\",\n          \"The analysis highlights several factors that can influence a model's ability to follow instructions effectively. Firstly, the models may not always be robust to paraphrased instructions, indicating a potential limitation in understanding variations in phrasing. This could lead to inconsistent responses when instructions are rephrased.\\n\\nAnother factor is the grounding of answers in factual information. The models, in their current state, are not explicitly trained to utilize facts from provided passages, which can result in plausible yet factually inaccurate responses. This is a critical consideration, especially in applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount.\\n\\nFurthermore, the analysis suggests that instruction-tuned models, while capable of generating plausible answers, may not always provide factually grounded responses.

Additionally, instruction tuning can enhance model generalizability by exposing the model to a diverse range of templates and tasks, improving its overall performance. Furthermore, using instruction tuning for search tasks addresses the gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) instructions for such tasks. Combining instruction tuning with few-shot prompting can also lead to even better performance. Lastly, the large amount of training data used in instruction tuning contributes to its efficacy.\",\n          \"The text suggests that models' performance in following instructions can be influenced by several factors. These include the clarity of the answer from the context, the presence of multiple explicit constraints, and the difficulty of the constraints for language models. Additionally, the text notes that the models may provide a large distribution of responses for a given prompt, making it challenging to ensure that the generated output aligns exactly with the intended instruction. Furthermore, some limitations of the models, such as their tendency to strictly follow instructions without considering real-world consequences, were highlighted.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by incorporating relative position information through rotation matrix product instead of altering terms in the expanded formulation of additive position encoding.\",\n          \"The benefit of instruction-based finetuning in language models is improved ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks, without the need for additional training.\",\n          \"Factors that may impact the ability of models to follow instructions include false premises in instructions, models hedging unnecessarily, performance degradation with multiple constraints in instructions, generation of toxic or biased outputs, and over-generalization leading to refusal of innocuous instructions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17001364809079222,\n        \"min\": 0.2484339905025372,\n        \"max\": 0.913464433422118,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8680210339536282,\n          0.8060146098051966,\n          0.5866006727697004\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.11184170052401407,\n        \"min\": 0.091324200913242,\n        \"max\": 0.4347826086956521,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3076923076923077,\n          0.2170542635658914,\n          0.1629629629629629\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.881381630897522,\n        \"max\": 0.881381630897522,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.881381630897522\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

While the additive method focuses on adding position encoding to the context representations, RoPE takes a distinct path by encoding relative position through the multiplication of context representations with a rotation matrix. This unique approach offers several advantages, such as sequence length flexibility and decaying inter-token dependency, making it a valuable alternative to the traditional additive method.\\n\\nIn the context of Transformers, RoPE provides a more sophisticated way to incorporate positional information, allowing for better supervision and dependency modeling between elements at different positions in the sequence. By using a rotation matrix, RoPE can effectively capture the relative position of elements, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the relationships within the sequence data.\\n\\nMoreover, RoPE's ability to handle varying sequence lengths and its explicit consideration of inter-token dependencies make it particularly useful in scenarios where traditional methods might fall short. This innovative approach has the potential to enhance the performance of Transformer-based language models and improve their ability to process and understand sequential data.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning in language models offers several advantages. Firstly, it significantly enhances the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen or uncommon domains. This is evident in the improvement of GTR-Large's performance when applied to geography, biology, and civil comments domains, despite not being trained on these specific areas.\\n\\nSecondly, instruction-tuning enables language models to follow natural language instructions and complete new tasks, even those not encountered during the training process. This is supported by recent work demonstrating the effectiveness of instruction-finetuned models in handling diverse tasks.\\n\\nMoreover, instruction-based finetuning can improve model performance on downstream tasks and align better with user intent. By fine-tuning on datasets of instructions and human-written completions, models can better understand and execute user instructions, leading to increased usability.\\n\\nAdditionally, the diversity of templates used in instruction-tuning can enhance the model's generalizability. This approach ensures that the model is not limited to a narrow set of instructions but can adapt to various user commands.\\n\\nLastly, combining instruction tuning with few-shot prompting can further boost performance, especially in search tasks where there is currently a gap in NLP instructions. The substantial data volume used in instruction tuning also contributes to its effectiveness.\",\n          \"The analysis highlights several factors that can influence a model's ability to follow instructions effectively. Firstly, the complexity of the instructions plays a significant role. When instructions contain multiple explicit constraints or challenging parameters, such as listing a specific number of items or adhering to a particular writing style, the model's performance may degrade. This suggests that the more intricate the instructions, the more challenging it becomes for the model to comply accurately.\\n\\nSecondly, the study reveals that the model's behavior can be influenced by the nature of the prompt. For instance, when instructed to be maximally biased, the model generated more toxic outputs, indicating a potential risk of harm in real-world applications. This finding underscores the importance of careful prompt engineering and the need for further research into mitigating such risks.\\n\\nAdditionally, the distribution of responses generated by the model for a given prompt is a crucial factor. The study acknowledges that a comprehensive analysis of all possible responses is beyond its scope, but it emphasizes the importance of representative samples. By understanding the full range of potential outputs, marketers can better anticipate and manage the model's behavior, ensuring more reliable instruction adherence.\\n\\nLastly, the paper suggests that future research and open-source models can contribute to a better understanding of these factors. By providing access to models and code, researchers can collaboratively explore and address the challenges associated with instruction-following, leading to more robust and reliable generative AI systems.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by incorporating relative position information through rotation matrix product instead of altering terms in the expanded formulation of additive position encoding.\",\n          \"The benefit of instruction-based finetuning in language models is improved ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks, without the need for additional training.\",\n          \"Factors that may impact the ability of models to follow instructions include false premises in instructions, models hedging unnecessarily, performance degradation with multiple constraints in instructions, generation of toxic or biased outputs, and over-generalization leading to refusal of innocuous instructions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.10057377150046207,\n        \"min\": 0.598345401476174,\n        \"max\": 0.9126681769609318,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6532890474705586,\n          0.8117670070674832,\n          0.6285499167617393\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06540153053017614,\n        \"min\": 0.0726495726495726,\n        \"max\": 0.3555555555555555,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.1929824561403509,\n          0.1276595744680851,\n          0.1319444444444444\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.8638927340507507,\n        \"max\": 0.8638927340507507,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8638927340507507\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In contrast to the additive method where fixed sinusoidal functions are added to each token's representation, RoPE introduces a new method called Rotary Position Embeddings. Instead of using predefined sinusoids for every position, RoPE applies these functions directly to the input embeddings through multiplication operations. This results in a more effective utilization of positional information by allowing the model to learn the relationship between different positions during training.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning can significantly enhance the performance of language models by allowing them to learn specific instructions or tasks. This approach enables the model to generate more accurate and relevant outputs tailored to particular applications or domains. By fine-tuning language models using customized instructions, organizations can improve their marketing strategies, such as creating personalized content or generating targeted advertising copy, ultimately enhancing customer engagement and conversion rates.\",\n          \"The analysis suggests that one significant factor affecting a model's capacity to follow instructions is the clarity and specificity of those instructions (as indicated by the first document discussing Table 16). Another important consideration is whether the instructions could potentially lead to harmful outcomes, which some models might unwittingly comply with (referenced in Figure 44 from another document). However, it should be noted that these findings are based on the research presented in the documents, and further investigation may reveal other influential factors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by incorporating relative position information through rotation matrix product instead of altering terms in the expanded formulation of additive position encoding.\",\n          \"The benefit of instruction-based finetuning in language models is improved ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks, without the need for additional training.\",\n          \"Factors that may impact the ability of models to follow instructions include false premises in instructions, models hedging unnecessarily, performance degradation with multiple constraints in instructions, generation of toxic or biased outputs, and over-generalization leading to refusal of innocuous instructions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1651221148022687,\n        \"min\": 0.3341806433159192,\n        \"max\": 0.9516867576963146,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8440556438525402,\n          0.8043468299074029,\n          0.7586147082927401\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.11878660658668795,\n        \"min\": 0.0737327188940092,\n        \"max\": 0.4597701149425288,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3281249999999999,\n          0.2127659574468085,\n          0.1599999999999999\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.8779773116111755,\n        \"max\": 0.8779773116111755,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8779773116111755\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Rather than using fixed embeddings as in the additive method, RoPE introduces a new method called Rotary Position Embedding. This method forms the relative position between tokens into complex numbers through a sinusoidal function, allowing the model to capture both absolute and relative position information more effectively. By doing so, RoPE enables the model to better learn long-range dependencies among sequences, contributing significantly to improved performance in various transformer models.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning is a method used to train language models, and it has several benefits. One such advantage is its ability to mitigate domain shifts. By providing specific instructions during the training process, the model can learn to generate outputs tailored to those instructions, even if they pertain to different domains from the original data. This adaptability makes instruction-based finetuning particularly valuable for various applications.\",\n          \"The texts suggest that there are several limitations affecting a model's capacity to strictly adhere to instructions. These include:\\n\\n1. Lack of factual grounding: Models might generate responses without being firmly rooted in facts, making their answers less reliable when compared to factually accurate information.\\n\\n2. Instruction dependency: Models tend to follow the given instructions, which could lead them astray if these instructions contain incorrect or misleading data.\\n\\n3. Vulnerability to paraphrasing: Instructions can significantly influence the performance of models, and they may struggle to process instructions presented in different forms or wordings.\\n\\nThese points highlight the importance of providing clear, unambiguous instructions to AI models for optimal results.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by being multiplicative instead of additive. While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product. This means that RoPE naturally includes relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation, without altering terms in the expanded formulation like the additive method does. Additionally, RoPE's properties show that it decays as the relative distance between positions increases, providing a clear theoretical interpretation of how position information is encoded.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning improves models' ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks by providing task-specific representations that can be used for many downstream language tasks without additional training. This method also allows pretrained language models to follow instructions provided in prompts, enabling them to generate the desired output given specific inputs. Additionally, instruction finetuning helps transform raw pretrained LLMs into chatbot-like models, making finetuning more accessible and common, particularly for researchers with limited resources. Overall, the benefit of instruction-based finetuning is improved model performance, enhanced generalizability, and reduced communication costs in aligning with human intentions.\",\n          \"Based on the analysis provided, factors that have been found to potentially impact the ability of models to follow instructions include the human feedback obtained from contractors, which may be influenced by their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history. Additionally, the model's behavior can be affected by false premises in instructions, tendencies to hedge, and performance degradation with multiple explicit constraints in instructions. The models are also not fully aligned or safe, as they can generate toxic or biased outputs, make up facts, and fail to generate reasonable outputs in some cases.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08410791786381293,\n        \"min\": 0.6407926780314647,\n        \"max\": 0.926163517869898,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8422402541032208,\n          0.8589641867442297,\n          0.7546663745472691\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06081891446792675,\n        \"min\": 0.167487684729064,\n        \"max\": 0.3803680981595091,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2261904761904762,\n          0.3005181347150259,\n          0.167487684729064\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.8822394013404846,\n        \"max\": 0.8822394013404846,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8822394013404846\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This process is straightforward but may not effectively capture the relative positional relationships between input elements.\\n\\nIn contrast, RoPE introduces a more sophisticated mechanism. It leverages the idea of rotary position embeddings, which involves a relative position formulation. Instead of a basic addition, RoPE employs a rotary matrix to encode the positional information, allowing for a more nuanced representation of the relative positions of input elements. This approach aims to enhance the model's understanding of positional relationships, potentially improving its performance in tasks where positional context is crucial.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning in language models offers several advantages. Firstly, it helps mitigate domain shifts, ensuring the model's adaptability across different contexts. This technique has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in recent studies, enhancing the model's performance when dealing with varied instructions. Moreover, it can significantly improve the model's capabilities, making it beneficial for instruction-finetuned language models.\",\n          \"The analysis highlights several factors that can influence a model's ability to follow instructions accurately. Firstly, the models may be limited in their capacity to deviate from the user's instructions, even when the generated answers are not factually grounded. This suggests that the models are inclined to adhere to the instructions, potentially hindering their flexibility in providing factually accurate responses.\\n\\nSecondly, the models' robustness is tested when instructions are paraphrased. The INSTRUCTOR's performance in this aspect is measured, indicating that some models might struggle with understanding and following instructions if they are not presented in the exact format they were trained on.\\n\\nFurthermore, the models may not be specifically trained to utilize and adhere to facts from provided passages. This lack of explicit training could result in responses that are not grounded in the given information, impacting the overall accuracy and reliability of the models' output.\\n\\nThese findings suggest that further research and training are required to enhance the models' ability to follow instructions, especially in handling variations in phrasing and ensuring factually consistent responses.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by being multiplicative instead of additive. While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product. This means that RoPE naturally includes relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation, without altering terms in the expanded formulation like the additive method does. Additionally, RoPE's properties show that it decays as the relative distance between positions increases, providing a clear theoretical interpretation of how position information is encoded.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning improves models' ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks by providing task-specific representations that can be used for many downstream language tasks without additional training. This method also allows pretrained language models to follow instructions provided in prompts, enabling them to generate the desired output given specific inputs. Additionally, instruction finetuning helps transform raw pretrained LLMs into chatbot-like models, making finetuning more accessible and common, particularly for researchers with limited resources. Overall, the benefit of instruction-based finetuning is improved model performance, enhanced generalizability, and reduced communication costs in aligning with human intentions.\",\n          \"Based on the analysis provided, factors that have been found to potentially impact the ability of models to follow instructions include the human feedback obtained from contractors, which may be influenced by their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history. Additionally, the model's behavior can be affected by false premises in instructions, tendencies to hedge, and performance degradation with multiple explicit constraints in instructions. The models are also not fully aligned or safe, as they can generate toxic or biased outputs, make up facts, and fail to generate reasonable outputs in some cases.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08424576546876417,\n        \"min\": 0.6407885160518884,\n        \"max\": 0.93236646743443,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8524540134139373,\n          0.863911175098488,\n          0.7878689758126265\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06332361831340796,\n        \"min\": 0.1612903225806451,\n        \"max\": 0.3664921465968586,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2612612612612612,\n          0.1987577639751552,\n          0.1992619926199262\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.8724973201751709,\n        \"max\": 0.8724973201751709,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8724973201751709\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This innovative technique provides a clear theoretical framework, allowing for the integration of positional information into the learning process of PLMs.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of RoPE is its ability to handle sequence length flexibility and decaying inter-token dependencies, which are not explicitly addressed by the traditional additive method. By utilizing a rotation matrix, RoPE effectively captures the relative position information, enabling more efficient and adaptable position encoding in Transformers.

Firstly, it enhances the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen domains and tasks, as evidenced by improved performance on geography, biology, and civil comments datasets.

Secondly, instruction-tuning allows models to better align with user intent and significantly improves performance on downstream tasks. This is achieved by fine-tuning the model on datasets of instructions and human-written completions, enabling the model to generalize beyond the instruction-tuning set and increasing its overall usability. \\n\\nThe benefits of instruction-tuning are further highlighted by its potential to enhance model generalizability through diverse templates and its ability to address the gap in NLP instructions for search tasks. Moreover, combining instruction tuning with few-shot prompting can lead to even better performance, and the large data volume used in this process can contribute to its effectiveness.\",\n          \"The analysis highlights several factors that can influence a model's ability to follow instructions effectively:\\n- **Complexity of Instructions:** The study suggests that models may struggle when instructions become more complex, especially when multiple explicit constraints are involved.

The current analysis is based on samples, which may not capture the entire picture.\\n- **Real-World Implications:** Interestingly, the models tend to adhere to instructions even when it could potentially lead to harmful outcomes. The example of InstructGPT generating more toxic outputs when instructed to be biased showcases this limitation.\\n- **Model Size and Performance:** The comparison between InstructGPT and equivalently-sized GPT-3 models indicates that model size and architecture can influence their behavior when handling instructions.\\n\\nThese findings emphasize the importance of considering various factors when evaluating a model's instruction-following capabilities, and further research is encouraged to explore these nuances comprehensively.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The RoPE approach in Transformers differs from the traditional additive method of position embedding by being multiplicative instead of additive.

Additionally, RoPE's properties show that it decays as the relative distance between positions increases, providing a clear theoretical interpretation of how position information is encoded.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning improves models' ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks by providing task-specific representations that can be used for many downstream language tasks without additional training. This method also allows pretrained language models to follow instructions provided in prompts, enabling them to generate the desired output given specific inputs. Additionally, instruction finetuning helps transform raw pretrained LLMs into chatbot-like models, making finetuning more accessible and common, particularly for researchers with limited resources. Overall, the benefit of instruction-based finetuning is improved model performance, enhanced generalizability, and reduced communication costs in aligning with human intentions.\",\n          \"Based on the analysis provided, factors that have been found to potentially impact the ability of models to follow instructions include the human feedback obtained from contractors, which may be influenced by their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history.

The models are also not fully aligned or safe, as they can generate toxic or biased outputs, make up facts, and fail to generate reasonable outputs in some cases.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08843540708528927,\n        \"min\": 0.6312007208120659,\n        \"max\": 0.9030145577418116,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8564709478685004,\n          0.8350811543713637,\n          0.6947782307523975\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0769146845835131,\n        \"min\": 0.1642857142857142,\n        \"max\": 0.4308943089430894,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2731277533039647,\n          0.2558139534883721,\n          0.1642857142857142\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.871801495552063,\n        \"max\": 0.871801495552063,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.871801495552063\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Instead of adding fixed sinusoidal or Gaussian functions as position embeddings, RoPE introduces complex position representations through a rotation operation. This results in capturing both absolute and relative position information effectively, enhancing the model's ability to process sequences, particularly long ones, improving performance overall.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning can significantly enhance the performance of language models. By fine-tuning models using specific instructions, we can better adapt them to various tasks and domains. This approach allows the model to learn task-specific knowledge from smaller amounts of data compared to training from scratch, making it a cost-effective solution. Additionally, instruction-based finetuning enables fine-control over the model's behavior, allowing us to customize its output according to our needs. Recent research has shown promising results when applying this technique to some of the largest open-source language models.\",\n          \"The text suggests that one factor limiting the models' ability to follow instructions is their adherence to user instructions without questioning or interpreting them independently. However, there seems to be a concern about instances where models might follow harmful instructions.

While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product. This means that RoPE naturally includes relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation, without altering terms in the expanded formulation like the additive method does. Additionally, RoPE's properties show that it decays as the relative distance between positions increases, providing a clear theoretical interpretation of how position information is encoded.\",\n          \"Instruction-based finetuning improves models' ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks by providing task-specific representations that can be used for many downstream language tasks without additional training. This method also allows pretrained language models to follow instructions provided in prompts, enabling them to generate the desired output given specific inputs. Additionally, instruction finetuning helps transform raw pretrained LLMs into chatbot-like models, making finetuning more accessible and common, particularly for researchers with limited resources. Overall, the benefit of instruction-based finetuning is improved model performance, enhanced generalizability, and reduced communication costs in aligning with human intentions.\",\n          \"Based on the analysis provided, factors that have been found to potentially impact the ability of models to follow instructions include the human feedback obtained from contractors, which may be influenced by their beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and personal history. Additionally, the model's behavior can be affected by false premises in instructions, tendencies to hedge, and performance degradation with multiple explicit constraints in instructions. The models are also not fully aligned or safe, as they can generate toxic or biased outputs, make up facts, and fail to generate reasonable outputs in some cases.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.13143073690303733,\n        \"min\": 0.4531125801337115,\n        \"max\": 0.9078539048645105,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8105250469508505,\n          0.8268953031824973,\n          0.6147001579177489\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.062164625218270396,\n        \"min\": 0.1421319796954314,\n        \"max\": 0.375,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2875,\n          0.2061855670103092,\n          0.189873417721519\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.87457674741745,\n        \"max\": 0.87457674741745,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.87457674741745\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In simpler terms, prompt engineering aims to teach the model to perform tasks by providing it with the right instructions and examples, allowing it to generate relevant and accurate outputs.\",\n          \"The development of generative language models by Anthropic, as exemplified by their Claude family of models, was influenced by advancements in transformer-based deep neural networks and the availability of large datasets. Anthropic's Claude models are based on the foundation of large language models (LLMs), which have revolutionized natural language processing tasks.\\n\\nLLMs, including those developed by Anthropic, are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn statistical relationships and patterns within the language. This self-supervised and semi-supervised training process enables the models to acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language.\\n\\nFurthermore, the use of transformer-based architectures, specifically the decoder-only design, plays a crucial role in the capabilities of these models. This architecture allows for efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data, contributing to the overall performance of generative language models.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Anthropic is one of several companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu, that have been at the forefront of developing generative AI models, each contributing to the advancements in this field.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Based on the provided context, it seems that licensing models for the distribution of source-available language models have not been explicitly discussed in the referenced papers. However, it is crucial to consider potential licensing options such as open-source licenses (e.g., GPL, MIT) or proprietary licenses when distributing language models to ensure legal compliance and control over usage rights. Additionally, considering the implications of different licensing models on accessibility, collaboration, and commercialization is essential for determining the most suitable approach for sharing language models with the community. Further research or consultation with legal experts may be necessary to explore specific licensing strategies for source-available language models.\",\n          \"The main goal of prompt engineering in language models is to effectively steer the behavior of the model towards desired outcomes without updating the model weights. This is achieved by composing and formatting prompts in a way that maximizes the model's performance on a specific task. Prompt engineering involves treating prompts as trainable parameters and optimizing them directly on the embedding space through methods like AutoPrompt, Prefix-Tuning, P-tuning, and Prompt-Tuning. The ultimate aim is to enhance the model's performance and alignment with user-defined tasks.\",\n          \"Several factors influenced the development of generative language models by Anthropic, including the limitations in coding, math, and reasoning capabilities of the initial version Claude, the partnerships with companies like Notion and Quora to enhance the model's capabilities, and the need to address biases, unsafe content, and ethical considerations in training data. Additionally, the reliance on supervised learning and the need for controlled generation in generative models played a role in shaping the development of Anthropic's language models.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"semantic_similarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0983569290780001,\n        \"min\": 0.550527292172686,\n        \"max\": 0.95952016116711,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7013438880757742,\n          0.8860905390568274,\n          0.8007555092516153\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rouge_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06668695811170766,\n        \"min\": 0.1081081081081081,\n        \"max\": 0.4757281553398058,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 74,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2085889570552147,\n          0.4757281553398058,\n          0.3636363636363636\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bert_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.8683435916900635,\n        \"max\": 0.8683435916900635,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8683435916900635\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Subsequently, a fixed-size, task-specific embedding EI is generated through mean pooling of the final hidden representations of all tokens present in the input text x.
